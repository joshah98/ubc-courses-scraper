# UBC courses web scraper
This will scrape the UBC website and store every section of every course offered at UBC, and store it in a json file. This ends up being roughly 18 000 sections. While looking at this file you may be thinking "this looks like it'll be quite slow, I'm sure there's a faster way". You'd be correct. I'm currently working on remaking this with aiohttp because accessing all 18 000 pages synchronously is not fun..
